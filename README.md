# Cyclistic Business Intelligence Capstone

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the Google Business Intelligence Professional Certificate and focuses on uncovering behavioral insights from New York City’s Cyclistic bike-sharing data. The goal was to support business decisions and provide a strategy to increase annual membership subscriptions.

## 🎯 Objective
Analyze rider trends using historical trip data to:
- Identify differences between casual and annual members
- Uncover behavioral patterns based on time and location
- Recommend a BI strategy to drive member conversion

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **SQL:** Data cleaning, joining, and exploratory queries
- **Tableau (.twbx):** Interactive dashboards and visual insights
- **PowerPoint (.pptx):** Final stakeholder-facing presentation
- **Google Docs (.md):** Project brief and strategic documentation
